I am an [independent strategy consultant](/consulting.md), an [expert in publishing and AI](/training.md), and an [experienced keynote speaker and panellist](/speaking.md). 

Since setting up my consulting practice in 2020, I have worked with more than thirty-five clients in ten countries. Typical engagements include strategy reviews, AI and digital transformation, scenario planning, go-to-market advice for startups, and designing and facilitating away days and corporate events. This builds on extensive senior executive experience in the publishing and media space, including fifteen years at the Big Five trade publisher Hachette. I am also an experienced non-executive director and currently [serve as Chairman of the communications group Midas](https://www.midaspr.co.uk) and [as a director of Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing](https://www.bdspublishing.com).

In 2023, working with the Independent Publishers Guild, I developed the first independent, CPD-accredited training course on generative AI specifically designed for the publishing industry. I have delivered that to delegates from more than two hundred and fifty organisations around the world. It was recognised as Best Learning/Professional Development programme at the 2024 Association Excellence Awards. 

I'm a regular speaker, panellist and chair at conferences, book fairs and corporate events.

I live in Wiltshire with my wife and daughters. I am a Fellow of the RSA and a Liveryman in the Stationers' Company. I attended the Yale Publishing Course and hold an MBA from Bayes Business School (formerly known as Cass).
