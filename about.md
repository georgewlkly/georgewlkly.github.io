I am an [independent strategy consultant](/consulting), an [expert in publishing and AI](/training), an [experienced keynote speaker and panellist](/speaking), and a [doctoral candidate at Bristol Business School](/research). 

Since setting up my consulting practice in 2020, I have worked with more than thirty-five clients in ten countries. Typical engagements include strategy reviews, go-to-market advice for startups, away days and corporate events. This builds on extensive senior executive experience in the publishing and media space, including fifteen years at Hachette UK. 

In 2023, working with the Independent Publishers Guild, I developed the first independent, CPD-accredited training course on generative AI specifically aimed at the publishing industry. I have delivered that to delegates from more than two hundred organisations around the world. 

I'm a regular speaker, panellist and chair at conferences, book fairs and corporate events.

Alongside my consulting and training work, I am a part-time doctoral candidate (DBA) at Bristol Business School. My research is on the use of games and scenarios as strategy tools. 

I live in Wiltshire with my wife and daughters.
