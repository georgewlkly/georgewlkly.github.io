In 2023 I was asked by the [Independent Publishers Guild](https://www.independentpublishersguild.com/IPG/IPG/Home_page_content/Home.aspx), a leading publishing trade association, to develop a training course on how publishers could make the most of Generative AI. I spent a period of several months researching the subject and talking to technology companies, investors, researchers, publishing and media organisations and early adopters in other sectors. The training was introduced in September 2023. Since then it has been delivered to delegates from more than two hundred organisations. To my knowledge, the training is the world's first independent, CPD-accredited AI course aimed specifically at the publishing industry. 

There are several options, which can be delivered in-person or remotely:
* Periodic open courses, where anyone can register
* In-company training for teams of up to 20
* Bespoke courses for larger clients or more complex use cases

All course options offer:
* An overview of the AI landscape, key concepts and tools
* Key issues, risks and opportunities
* AI strategy and implementation
* Hands-on experience with a range of AI tools and models, based on proven use cases
