## Methodology

Companies House registration data is available via [API](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk) or [.csv data download (one file, or in seven smaller parts)](https://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html). Either way, Python is the starting point for analysis: the data .csv is too large to open in Excel, and working manually with seven separate files would be impractical. I used ChatGPT o4-mini-high to vibecode Python scripts based on my instructions&#8212;I’m not a great coder, but I can describe a process and output clearly. The results were pretty good: a couple of times, the scripts threw errors, but pasting those back into the model and developing the scripts resolved all the issues. As the role of the LLM is writing a script for testing, and the actual analysis is carried about using a validated Python script, outputs are consistent and repeatable, with no risk of hallucination.

Limited companies specify one or more [Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes](https://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic/) to describe their activities: for this exercise I selected companies claiming at least one of SIC codes *58110 – Book publishing* and *58141 – Publishing of learned journals*. These codes are self-declared by the registrant and there may be some inaccuracy in the data, but they are the best starting point. I considered adding *58190 - Other publishing activities*, but this was a particularly messy code that probably included some book and journal publishing, but also just about every other media format. 

Outputting just companies using one of these SIC codes resulted in an extract of 12,150 companies. Once I had this, I worked on a second stage Python script to generate monthly delta files so I can keep my dataset updated with new company formations and changes to status. The outputs are small enough that I can work with them in Excel, at least for an experimental phase (down the road, I will automate repeated analysis in Python). 

Finally, I wanted to be able to plot the initial results on a map. A third Python script consolidated the Companies House data by postcode and number of companies. For the visualisation, ChatGPT recommended a platform called [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de). This worked well initially but twice failed to convert the complete list of 8,000+ postcodes into latitude and longitude data which it required for plotting. So, I went back to vibecoding in Python and prompted a short script which passed the location data to a free API, [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io), and obtained latitude and longitude from there. This worked for 99%+ of the postcodes but identified a small number of errors which I corrected manually. Datawrapper imported the postcodes.io data without any issues, and it took about ten minutes of playing around with settings to configure and publish the interactive map above. 

All told, this took less than three hours, including experimentation and testing; an experienced Python developer would have got through it significantly faster. But it’s a good illustration of what can be done with a clear idea of the end product, an AI model and some experimentation.
