I started my independent consulting business, Outside Context Ltd, in 2020, off the back of nearly twenty-five years of digital disruption and transformation in the media and publishing sector. The name was a nod to a favourite author, Iain M. Banks (with whom I had been lucky enough to work earlier in my career): [in his concept of an outside context problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession), I saw parallels with some of the incumbents and challengers I had worked with.

Since then, I have worked with more than thirty five clients in ten countries, mainly in media and publishing, educational, non-profits and professional services. This builds on extensive senior executive experience, including fifteen years at Hachette UK, and [more recent domain expertise in AI](/training.md). Typical services include:

* Strategy reviews, especially around publishing, digital, content and AI strategy
* Designing and facilitating away days and corporate events
* Business development, including partnerships and commercial deals
* Horizon scanning and scenario planning
