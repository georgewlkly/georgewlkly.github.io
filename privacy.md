This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights under UK data protection laws, including the UK GDPR.

### Data Collection and Use

This website is a static HTML site. We only collect limited personal information through third-party services.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics 4 to understand how visitors use the site, such as which pages are visited and for how long. This helps us improve site content and user experience. Google Analytics collects information such as IP address and device data, which is processed as personal data under UK GDPR. We process this data on the basis of your consent. We only use analytics data in aggregated form and do not use it for marketing or profiling purposes. You can withdraw your consent or object to this processing at any time by blocking analytics cookies in your browser settings or by contacting us. Google Analytics sets cookies on your device subject to your consent. Analytics data is retained for 2 months. Some data may be processed in the United States under the UK–US Data Bridge framework or equivalent safeguards. For more details, see Google’s Privacy Policy.

### Kit

If you choose to sign up for our email list, we collect your email address through Kit so that we can send you updates or news. This is done only with your explicit consent when you complete the signup form. Kit may set functional cookies necessary for the signup form to work properly. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails. Some data may be processed in the United States under appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses. For more information, see ConvertKit’s Privacy Policy.

We do not sell or share your personal data with other third parties. Data is stored securely and retained only for as long as necessary: analytics data for 2 months, and email data until you unsubscribe.

### Cookies
Cookies are small files stored on your device that help understand how the site is used. We do not set cookies ourselves. The only cookies used are: Google Analytics cookies: used to collect aggregated usage statistics, subject to your consent; and Kit cookies: used to enable email signup form functionality. You can block or delete cookies at any time through your browser settings. Blocking analytics cookies will not affect your ability to use the site, though blocking Kit cookies may prevent the signup form from working.

### Your Data Rights

Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), you have the right to: access any personal data we hold about you, request correction or deletion of your data, object to or restrict processing or withdraw consent for marketing communications at any time. To exercise these rights or ask questions, please contact us using the details at the top of this policy. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

### Policy Updates

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date, and we recommend checking periodically for updates.
