I'm on my way back from the IPG Spring Conference in London, always one of the highlights of the publishing year. It was a really good mix of the inspirational and the practical, and I particularly enjoyed the presentations from former Shazam chairman and crime writer Ajay Chowdhury, National Literacy Trust CEO Jonathan Douglas, BBC media editor Katie Razzall, Illumicrate CEO Daphne Tonge and Bonnier UK Co-CEOs Sarah Benton and Jonathan Perdoni. 

There was a lot of food for thought, and in a spirit of sharing, here are fifteen things I am thinking about as a result of the day. This list is a combination of statements made by speakers and my reflections. It's based on my shorthand notes, taken at face value. In general, the 'what' comes from the original speakers; the 'so what' and 'now what' are my thoughts. Any errors are mine, and I don't have data sources for all of these statement. As a result, I haven't attributed the original points to individuals, though you might guess many of them. 

1. The average British person has an hour less leisure time per day than in 2020. Publishing is competing for time as well as money. A structural reduction in leisure time intensifies competition from low-friction, short-form media. Publishers should optimise for clearer value proposition, tighter positioning and lower cognitive load. 
2. The marketing power of creating a product that becomes a verb (e.g. Shazam). Or I suppose an adjective (e.g. Dickensian, Orwellian, Kafkaesque). 
3. Shazam's initial training data came from ripping a warehouse of CDs bought from Woolworths (interesting to compare this with e.g. Anthropic buying physical books to OCR for training). Innovation often starts in legally grey areas before formal licensing frameworks mature, and data accumulation precedes governance. 
4. Larger independent publishers being happy in their own skin at sub–Big Five scale (including enhancing employment conditions and retention to get past the idea of being the farm team for larger houses). Scale isn't an end in its own right. 
5. How to reconcile long-term strategy&#8212;a stated aim to think generationally, not quarter-by-quarter&#8212;with short-term pressures. Carve out time for senior leaders away from the day-to-day, explicitly separate long-term moves from short-term KPIs, measure different things on the appropriate clock. 
6. Many of the macro pressures facing publishing are now secular/structural, not cyclical. Waiting for a bounce back/correction may be wishful thinking. Who in the industry is radically rethinking structure, cost-base, product, unit economics in line with this? 
7. If your company's mission statement could apply equally to any of your major competitors, either the statement isn't specific enough or your competitive positioning isn't.  
8. The FT used AI to rapidly develop an analysis tool, knowing the Epstein files were about to be released. As a result, they led news cycles. Execution speed and technical capability feed into product, attention, and narrative dominance. Preparedness compounds.
9. Power and influence are shifting from media institutions/gatekeepers to individual brands/fandoms. Does the role of a publisher shift from gatekeeper to ecosystem? 
10. Cf. point 2 above, the frustrating genericisation of 'Substack' to mean any professional, monetised email newsletter, not just the Nazi-adjacent ones. 
11. Is a podcast a replacement, a complement or a funnel for a book? Be clear about what the format is doing: directly monetising, engaging an audience, or building awareness. 
12. One major podcast producer found that video podcasts on YouTube were a totally different audience to traditional podcast channels&#8212;no cannibalisation, completely accretive. Publishers should test adjacent platforms without assuming zero-sum effects. 
13. One major book subscription product deliberately keeps potential paying customers on a waitlist, partly because it's hard to forecast growth and demand alongside long publishing lead times, so this smooths out the bumps, and partly as scarcity marketing. Constraint is strategic, not just a reflection of internal limitations. 
14. Only 7% of Instagram feeds is content from users' friends: the rest is algorithmically determined. Publishers can chase trends or optimise for relevance, or look to more neutral channels like email.
15. A view from outside the industry: publishing attitudes and decisions are determined more by the legacy business model than by optimising customer experience (100% agree with this).
