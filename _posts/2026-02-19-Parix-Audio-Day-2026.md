Thanks to Luis González, Javier Celaya, Christopher Kenneally and their colleagues for inviting me to give a keynote address on the impact of AI on audiobook publishing this morning at Parix Audio Day 2026 in Madrid. It's one of the best conferences in the publishing calendar, and hands down the best venue. 

It's a challenge to cover such an expansive subject in half an hour of presentation time, but I gave an overview of the impact of AI for authors, publishers, narrators and the competitive landscape. <a href="/downloads/Parix_Audio_19_February_2026.pdf">My slides from the day are available here</a>.
