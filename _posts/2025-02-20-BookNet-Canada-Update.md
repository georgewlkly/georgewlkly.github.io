title: BookNet Canada Update
---
Last September, [BookNet Canada invited me to speak at their Tech Forum webinar on the use of AI in publishing](https://www.georgewalkley.com/BookNet-Canada/). Looking back at my slides, it's remarkable how much the world has moved on since then, though the eight principles I set out have held up pretty well. 

What struck me most about this second session was not just how much the technology has evolved in the intervening months, but how the industry's concerns and priorities have also shifted. Many of the audience questions reflected an increased level of practical engagement with AI, moving beyond broad concerns about its potential to more specific, operational questions about how to implement it effectively and responsibly (particularly, how to do so as a small or medium-sized business with limited resources). At the same time, other questions highlighted the persistent, and increasingly urgent, ethical and legal challenges. Copyright remains a major issue, with ongoing debates about training data, ownership, and fair compensation for writers and other creatives. Questions about authorship and transparency show that concerns about credibility and consumer trust are growing in importance. 

Interestingly, the discussion also touched on the impact of AI on employment. This has been a recurring theme in AI discussions, but that conversation too is evolving. In my own experience of the industry, it's clear that while AI can help to automate certain tasks, it also creates opportunities, shifting roles rather than eliminating them. Understanding how to harness AI’s capabilities while maintaining the value of human expertise will be key to navigating this transformation.

Ultimately, the shift in audience questions from broad theoretical concerns to practical implementation challenges signals an important moment for the industry. AI in publishing is no longer a speculative future: it’s happening now. The key for publishers will be to engage thoughtfully, ensuring they balance innovation with ethical responsibility, transparency, and a clear-eyed view of the risks and rewards. I’m grateful to BookNet Canada for the opportunity to revisit this topic and discuss these evolving issues with Canadian publishers.
